It is the Techno Parking Guard, which is a device that has ultrasonic sensors that work in harmony. When this sensor finds a small distance to measure it gives a signal informing that a car is standing in this location and it directly shows on the board which is found at the entrance of the parking. This board gives red signals if there’s no place to park and no signal if there’s a place to park. Moreover, this device gives a warning if a car obstructs the way of other cars, and a voice will tell the driver not to park there, and this voice will repeat till the driver leaves the area.
